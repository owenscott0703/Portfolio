Background on Project:
This project was created in collaboration with a group for my Stat240 class. 
This project was open-ended and could be about any statistical problem we wanted, thus it does not follow any pre-existing template and is all independent work.
The parts of this project that I contributed is as follows: 
- Background
- Data Sources
- Data Structure
- Data Cleaning and Background
- Visual Articulation and Interpretation
- Results and Interpretation
- Further Interpretation
- Shortcomings of the Analysis
- Additional Questions and Recommendations for Future Research

Steps to running R code on your device:
1. Download [this]([url](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-access-research-atlas/download-the-data)) xlsx file from the usda.gov website
2. Modify the file so that only the varible sheet (containing: CensusTract, State, Country, etc..) is present and save as a csv
3. Lastly, make sure to modify line 50 of the project.final.RMD file to match where the dataset is located on your computer (this is the line of code that imports the csv file)
4. Quick reminder that R syntax is "../" to exit a folder, and "foldername/" to enter a folder. Each subsequent folder name or exiting must be seperated by a backslash "/".
5. Project is now set up and ready to run on your device!
